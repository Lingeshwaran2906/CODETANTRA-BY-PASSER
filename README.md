A lightweight Chrome extension built by **Lingesh Waran** to enhance the CodeTantra platform experience — allowing faster interactions, restoring paste functionality, and bypassing unnecessary restrictions on web activities.

- ⚡ **Popup UI** — quick toggle interface to enable or disable the bypass anytime.  
- 🔐 **Lightweight & Secure** — no external tracking, no data collection, and works locally.  
- 🧱 **Manifest V3 Support** — built for modern Chrome versions.  
- 💻 **Easy to Use** — load once, and it runs automatically whenever CodeTantra is opened.
